# Drinking-water-Analysis !!
## Analysis and Classification of Drinking Water using Machine Learning Algorithms!

#### _`As per the show on Netflix,'DOWN TO EARTH with zack efron', we came to know that paris has a pipeline of fresh water underneath and people generally drink that wherever they want.Probably the best network of freshly filtered tap water system.`_

Analysing the types of water that are up for consumption.


_Fresh water is the primary source of human health, prosperity, and security.By around 2050 the world's population is expected to reach about nine billion.
Assuming that standards of living continue to rise, the requirement of potable water for human consumption will amount to the resources of about three planet Earths.
A key United Nations report indicates that water shortages will affect 2.3 billion people or 30% of the world's population in four dozen nations by 2025. <br> Already, the crisis of potable water in most developing countries is creating public health emergencies of staggering proportions._


_The quality of water governs life of an organism on the earth.
Hence, researchers around the world are engaged on framing the systematic approach and policy for
the long-term conservation of good-quality water.
Historical evidences show that change in water quality and quantity due to anthropogenic pressure
has lead to vanish many settlements of human beings. Quality of water always depends on the
source of water, the storage technique and the treatment opted.
Water quality represents the purity of water and expresses the suitability of water for various uses
like drinking, industrial water supply, and irrigation, propagation of aquatic organisms and generation
of hydro power. <br><br> The water quality is assessed in order to determine its potability, safety of human contact and
ecosystem health. Poor quality of water is due to high level of organic and inorganic substance that
does not fit in the standard limits given by the government._


_Every person needs some liters of safe drinking water and water used for food preparation.
The amount of this water depends on climate, physical activity, body size, etc.
Already, many people have difficulties to get this essential waterâ€”at least during dry periods.
Sometimes, groundwater can be safe without any treatments. If surface waters are used as raw water
for potable water, usually, different treatments are needed to reduce organic matter, to control pH, to
disinfect water, etc. <br><br> We can get water by fetching it from wells or springs, or by buying it in bottles, tanks or via private or
common taps. In some areas, families, schools, etc., use different, additional filters or heating
treatments to make water safe. All stages, from raw water quality and its treatments in water supply
plants up to final storage in bottles, tanks or distribution pipe systems, have effect on the final quality
of drinking water and, thus, on human health and wellbeing. <br><br> Unfortunately, the price of water does not often correspond with the safety of water, so that water
piped to homes in industrial countries can be safe and cheap, but water bought in bottles or tanks in
developing countries can be expensive and unprotected._

_Outbreaks of waterborne disease and chronic adverse health effects of disinfection by-products
(DBPs) have generated potable water regulatory changes that have affected consumers, laboratories,
and clinics nationwide.<br>Existing and future regulations require numerous and better techniques for analysis of pathogens
and DBPs, as well as improved water treatment.<br>Membranes are the most versatile and promising technology for achieving higher-quality potable
water. Clinical personnel will develop and provide analytic techniques to meet these challenges._

## For Solving this Usecase, What I have done is :
- Collected the data and organized it to form a meaningful dataset.
- Checked for null values and took care of it.
- Observed the data to form meaningful insights!
<br><br>
- Did Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
- Used correlations to form a heatmap.
- Visualizations were made by using Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries..!!


## Did Data Pre-Processing :
- Made Binary Classifications Using Label Encoder
- and Standard Scaler
<br> to fit and transform Numerical and Categorical Column values.


## And then I made my model for the Prediction :
- Did Data Preprocessing.
- Independent and Dependent Features.
- Did Train-Test split



# Trained my Model using :

## _Random Forest Classifier_

- Predicted for the data
- Finded Accuracy score
- Plotted Confusion Matrix
- And at last, Classification report.
- And Analyzed the key factors responsible for prediction.


## _Logistic Regression_

- Predicted for the data
- Finded Accuracy score


## _XGBoost Classifier_

- Predicted for the data
- Finded Accuracy score
- Plotted Confusion Matrix
- And at last, Classification report.


## _Using K Neighbors Classifier_

- Predicted for the data
- Finded Accuracy score
- Plotted Confusion Matrix
- And at last, Classification report.
 

## _Support Vector Machine_

- Predicted for the data
- Finded Accuracy score
- Plotted Confusion Matrix
- And at last, Classification report.

## _And for the conclusion -_
#### _From the above Five trained Models, It can be seen that <br> With the Accuracy of around 72%, <br> the Support Vector Machine Classification model performed slightly better than Random Forest Classifier model and KNN Classifier._
